Progress So Far:

    Player Movement and Gravity Change: The core mechanics of player movement are implemented, and the gravity reversal system is working. The player can move across surfaces and reverse gravity to navigate the environment.

    Level Making: I’ve created a basic level design system. Each level’s data, including player spawn position, obstacles, and gravity-reversal points, is stored in a JSON file, which allows for easy modification and expansion of levels.

    Pixel Art for Player and Levels: Basic pixel art has been created for the player character and the levels. The art is designed to be simple and clear, with easy-to-distinguish surfaces and hazards.

    Level Loading and Collision Detection: Levels are loaded dynamically from the JSON files, and collision detection is functioning, preventing the player from passing through walls and floors.

Plans for the Next Steps:

    Sound Effects: I plan to add sound effects for gravity reversals, player movements, and interactions with obstacles. These will enhance the player's experience and make the game feel more responsive.

    Menus: I’ll implement menus, including a main menu, level selection, and pause screen. The menus will allow players to navigate through the game easily and start new levels.

    More Levels: I will design and implement additional levels, introducing new challenges and mechanics as the player progresses. The levels will be stored in JSON files and loaded into the game dynamically.

    Additional Art: I plan to create more pixel art, including environmental details, additional hazards, and decorative elements that help bring the game world to life while keeping the minimalist aesthetic.

    Animation: I plan to add animations for the player character and other in-game elements. For example, the player will have walking animations that change depending on whether gravity is normal or flipped. I’ll also create animations for interactions, such as pressing buttons or moving objects. Animating these actions will bring the game to life and make it feel more dynamic.
